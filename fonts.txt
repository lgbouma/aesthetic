Computer Modern
DejaVu Sans
Helvetica
Times New Roman
Arial

Matplotlib default is DejaVu Sans.  Suffers imcompatibility issues for e.g.
keynote loading on laptops that are not your own.

Compute modern / TeX only is serifed, which some view as aesthetically harder
to read than sans-serif.  Ditto Times New Roman.

That leaves Helvetica and Arial.  Either seems fine; default to Arial because
'Helvetica' is not a valid value for mathtext.fontset; supported values are
['dejavusans', 'dejavuserif', 'cm', 'stix', 'stixsans', 'custom']
