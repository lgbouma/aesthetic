Style-related tools that I re-use across projects in astronomy.

Most relevant are the style sheets, which produce default plots as in the
`/results/` directory.

__install__
Clone + `python setup.py install` from the repo. (or develop!)

__contents__

`aesthetic.plots`
* `set_style`
* `set_style_scatter`
* `savefig`
* `format_ax`

`aesthetic.papers`
* `abbreviate_the_bibliography`
